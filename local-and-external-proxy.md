If you're setting up a proxy to handle **both local and external traffic**, here's how you can use loopback addresses (`127.0.0.1` and `127.0.1.1`) alongside your network interface IP addresses (like `192.168.x.x`).

### Scenario 1: **Local Traffic (127.0.0.1)**
- You bind the proxy to `127.0.0.1` to handle **local requests**. This ensures that only applications on your system can access the proxy.
- Example: 
    - Local apps (like browsers or testing tools) can access `localhost:8080`, and the proxy can forward traffic to external sites or services.

### Scenario 2: **External Traffic (Network IP)**
- To handle **external traffic**, you will bind the proxy to your machine's actual network IP (e.g., `192.168.1.x`) so that other devices on the network or the internet can route through the proxy.
- Example:
    - Devices in your network could access the proxy via `192.168.1.x:8080`, and the proxy will handle requests similarly to the local setup.

### Scenario 3: **Multiple Local Services**
- Using `127.0.1.1` can help you **isolate multiple proxies or services**. For example:
    - You could set one proxy on `127.0.0.1:8080` for local traffic and another on `127.0.1.1:9090` for testing different services or configurations without conflicts.

### Example Configuration in Nginx (Local + External Proxies)
For this, you'd configure your proxy to handle both local (loopback) and external (network IP) traffic:

1. **Local Proxy on `127.0.0.1:8080`:**
    - Handle requests coming from the same machine.
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 127.0.0.1:8080;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://external-service.com;
        }
    }
    ```

2. **External Proxy on `192.168.1.x:8080`:**
    - Allow devices on your LAN or external clients to use the proxy.
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 192.168.1.x:8080;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://external-service.com;
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Additional Proxy on `127.0.1.1:9090`:**
    - For testing or running another service in isolation.
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 127.0.1.1:9090;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://another-service.com;
        }
    }
    ```

### UFW Configuration for External Traffic (Optional)
Since you mentioned using **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**, you need to allow access to the proxy port for external traffic:
```bash
sudo ufw allow from any to 192.168.1.x port 8080 proto tcp
```

In this configuration:
- **Local traffic** is handled via `127.0.0.1`.
- **External traffic** is routed through the network IP.
- **Multiple services** can run on separate loopback addresses if needed.

This setup allows you to control both internal and external traffic efficiently.
